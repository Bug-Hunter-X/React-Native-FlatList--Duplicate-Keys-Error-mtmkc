This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and attempting to render items that have a `key` prop that is not unique.  The key is used by React Native to identify and update list items efficiently.  Duplicate keys will cause React Native to fail to update correctly, leading to unexpected behavior such as items not rendering, incorrect items being displayed, or crashes. 

Example of incorrect usage:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.id}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Incorrect: Duplicate keys
/>
```

In this example, the `keyExtractor` function returns duplicate keys (`1`, `1`).
